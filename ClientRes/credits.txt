Ok...

Here's the original, unedited,
version of the intro text...
>TIME:4.0
##
A long time ago in a
galaxy much bigger than
my calves...
>TIME:4.0
##
There was this game
called "Heavy Metal"
and life was good.
>TIME:3.0
##
But then life turned
bad so we changed the
name to "Metal Tek".
>TIME:3.0
##
...and once again, life
was good.
##
Real good.
>TIME:0.4
##
Okay, life was still bad
so we changed the name
to "Riot".
>TIME:3.0
##
Now life was good, for
real this time.
>TIME:3.0
##
But, as always happens,
something just had to
screw things up and we
needed to change the 
name again. Okay, we just
couldn't control ourselves
and we changed it for no
real reason. The name
would be...

So, you are this dude who
lost his brother and girl-
friend during some battle.
>TIME:3.0
##
You're kinda a wuss so you
haven't really gotten over
the whole thing.
>TIME:3.0
##
But you're a good soldier
so the admiral wants you to
do some dirty work for him.
>TIME:3.0
##
That's cool because you get
to pilot a cool mecha of
your choice.
>TIME:3.0
##
This should make everything
perfectly clear.

That got some good laughs.

Well, we'd like to thank
all of the great people
who "kept the faith".

You know, people like
Doug Dyer, Gary Kussman,
the online gaming community,
and of course, all of
Monolith.

We'd also like to thank

Hey, did you know you

the pause key, and the
space-bar during the

Guess we should have told
